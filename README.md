# Simple-Hospital-Management-System-using-ADT-lists-and-Arrays-in-Java
This project utilizes key data structures—lists, queues, stacks, and recursion—to efficiently manage hospital patients. It categorizes them by city, prioritizes treatment based on severity, and optimizes resource allocation and reporting.

# 📌 Project Overview  
This project implements a **Hospital Patient Management System** using fundamental **data structures** such as **lists, queues, stacks, and recursion**. The system processes patient records, categorizes them by city, prioritizes treatment based on severity, and optimizes resource allocation efficiently.  

# 🚀 Features  
- **Patient Data Processing:** Reads and tokenizes patient records from a text file.  
- **Categorization by City:** Patients are sorted into city-specific lists for easy management.  
- **Severity-Based Queues:** Critical patients are added to priority queues for faster treatment.  
- **Delayed Service Stack:** Low-severity patients are stored in a stack for future monitoring.  
- **Recursive Reporting:** Served patient details are printed recursively for efficient reporting.  
- **Cost Calculation:** Computes total hospital expenses for patient treatment.  

# 🛠 Technologies & Concepts Used  
- **Data Structures:** Lists, Queues, Stacks  
- **Algorithms:** Recursion, Priority-based Queueing  
- **Programming Language:** JAVA


# 🏥 How It Works  
1. Reads and tokenizes patient records from a file.  
2. Stores patients in a **list** and categorizes them by city.  
3. Uses **queues** to prioritize treatment based on severity.  
4. Places low-severity patients in a **stack** for delayed service.  
5. Processes patient queues and updates treatment records.  
6. Prints served patients using **recursion** for efficient reporting.  
7. Calculates and displays total hospital costs.  

# 📌 Future Enhancements  
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI).  
- Add a database for persistent storage.  
- Improve efficiency with advanced algorithms.
